Kanetkar and Saumya Joshi. Anuraag has been dancing Salsa for 6 years, while
Saumya has a background in ballroom dancing before she got introduced to Salsa
two years ago. They could not help but fall in love with the verve of Salsa

students and dancers all over their city through classes and salsa nights. To
them, it's not just a dance form - it's a way of life. If you'd like to add a
