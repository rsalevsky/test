# Regular Classes

We conduct regular group classes around Pune. Contact us to find the branch
nearest to you!

# Private Lessons

Private sessions are one of the most effective ways to take your dancing to the
next level. These sessions can be scheduled according to our mutual convenience,
where the instructors come to you and customise the lessons as per your
requirements.

# Corporate Workshops

Latin Verve Dance Company also offers specialised workshops at corporate
offices throughout the city. These can be organised for a quarterly or annual
event, or as a series of workshops for your employees. The choreography will be
planned according to the event or the number of workshops required.

# Choreography and Shows

Latin Verve Dance Company offers choreography for corporate events as well as
weddings, customised to fit the client's requirements. Anuraag and Saumya are
also available for shows themselves. Their routines showcase elements of
hip-hop, freestyle, and ballroom, all with a base of Eddie Torres style classic
mambo.
